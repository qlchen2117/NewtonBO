    r"""Draw qMC samples from the box defined by bounds.

    Args:
        bounds: A `2 x d` dimensional tensor specifying box constraints on a
            `d`-dimensional space, where bounds[0, :] and bounds[1, :] correspond
            to lower and upper bounds, respectively.
        n: The number of (q-batch) samples. As a best practice, use powers of 2.
        q: The size of each q-batch.
        batch_shape: The batch shape of the samples. If given, returns samples
            of shape `n x batch_shape x q x d`, where each batch is an
            `n x q x d`-dim tensor of qMC samples.
        seed: The seed used for initializing Owen scrambling. If None (default),
            use a random seed.

    Returns:
        A `n x batch_shape x q x d`-dim tensor of qMC samples from the box
        defined by bounds.

    Example:
        >>> bounds = torch.stack([torch.zeros(3), torch.ones(3)])
        >>> samples = draw_sobol_samples(bounds, 16, 2)
